# PINNs-Review
We study the Physiscs Informed Neural Network theory, and apply it to solve the Fokker-Planck equation for 1D- and 2D-harmonic potentials, with absorbing and reflecting boundaries. We perform a hyper parameter search considering the characteristic failure modes of PINNs.
## Final Goals:
1) GridSearch on NN architecture
2) Loss landscape w.r.t. MSE(f) regularization parameter
3) 2D harmonic potential
4) Error bars on training w.r.t. some hyper-parameter
